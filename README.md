# Portfolio Project V1

This is a web portfolio created using Next.js, React.js, Chakra UI, and Framer Motion. It is a responsive website that can be used as a template for a portfolio. It is also a good example of how to use Next.js, React.js, Chakra UI, and Framer Motion together.

This is based on [Takuya Matsuyama](https://www.craftz.dog/), [Portfolio Project](https://github.com/craftzdog/craftzdog-homepage)
