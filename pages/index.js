              Hi there! My name is Jesus Junco, and I&apos;m a passionate software developer with a focus on backend development.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey in the world of IT began in January 2022 when I embarked on a transformative experience at Holberton School. Here I ganined a strong foundation in languages such as C, Python, and JavaScript, as well as expertise in SQL and MySQL. I also had the opportunity to work on exciting projects, including a web application developed using the MERN stack and a captivating video game created with Unity and C#.
            </p>
            <p>
              Resilience is one of my core qualities. I&apos;m the kind of person who never gives up and always goes the extra mile to achieve my goals. With a genuine love and passion for what I do, I strive to create software that is not only useful but also enjoyable for users. I firmly believe in putting people first and approaching every interaction with kindness and a smile.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;m currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer. If you&apos;re interested in working together, please don&apos;t hesitate to reach out!
